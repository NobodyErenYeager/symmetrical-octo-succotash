<p>This is a note in regards to the next lecture, we've gotten a lot of questions of why TO_CHAR "doesn't work" for one of the assessment questions. It actually does work, but you need to realize certain codes are "blank padded to 9 characters", which means instead of returning 'Monday' it returns 'Monday&nbsp; &nbsp;' with extra spaces to fill up at least 9 spaces.</p><p><br></p><p>Source:</p><p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-formatting.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/functions-formatting.html</a></p>
