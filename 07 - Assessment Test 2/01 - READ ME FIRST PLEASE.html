Note, some students who upgraded to windows 10 or MacOs catalina from older versions of the Operating System encounter a pgsql bug, its not an issue with the .tar file we give, but a bug with the way pgsql works with upgraded systems.</p><p>If you encounter any issues with the restore (the most common being the restore seems to work, but you don't see the cd schema, please follow along with the step by step instructions). Note, this is almost the same thing we show in the lecture, but I give you a raw .sql file instead of a .tar file. Please follow the troubleshooting steps:</p><p><br></p><p>1. Make sure you are using the latest version of pgAdmin, there are a few versions that were released that contained bugs. We have confirmed the restore process works on pgadmin 4.22 and please use PostgreSQL 12 (even if you are on an older OS, Postgresql 12 is likely supported by your OS now)</p><p>2. Make sure you selected PRE/POST/DATA for the restore as shown in the video</p><p>3. Make sure you refresh the database</p><p>4. Make sure your bin file path is set up correctly, this part is slightly more complex, so to make sure it is set up correctly:</p><p>In pgAdmin4 go to:</p><p><br></p><p>File &gt; Preferences &gt; Paths &gt; Binary paths &gt; PostgreSQL Binary Path</p><p><br></p><p>Sample paths as below (You need to change it according to your Postgres location),</p><p>If you are using Windows than provide path like,</p><p><br></p><p>C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\12\bin</p><p><br></p><p>If you are using Linux than provide path like,</p><p><br></p><p>/opt/PostgreSQL/12/bin</p><p><br></p><p>If you are using Mac than provide path where you have installed PG,</p><p><br></p><p>/Library/PostgreSQL/12/bin</p><p>Try a new restore and refresh after those changes and see if that fixes the issue. </p><p><br></p>
